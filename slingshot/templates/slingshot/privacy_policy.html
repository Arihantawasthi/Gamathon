        <h2>Privacy Policy: </h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">OVERVIEW :</p>
        <p> Gamathon Pvt Ltd ("Gamathon", "our", "us" or "we") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal and other information that we receive or obtain from visitors to www.gamathon.gg and/or other websites and property managed by Gamathon or our affiliates ("Gamathon Sites"), and from customers and other users of the services and offerings of Gamathon and its affiliates (the "Services").</p>
        <br>

            We update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any material changes before the changes take effect by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Gamathon Sites. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. The date of the last revision appears at the top of the Privacy Policy. As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates internationally.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We collect, use and disclose information to administer, monitor, and improve the Gamathon Sites, the features and content, to provide and improve the Services and verify that users of the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do this so as to improve user experiences for Gamathon Site visitors, customers, and users of our Services.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By accepting this Privacy Policy, using our Services or providing us with your Personal Information (as defined below), you consent to the collection, use, disclosure (including transfer) and sharing of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please do not provide us with any Personal Information if you do not agree to us using your Personal Information in this manner.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How We Collect Information; Kinds of Information We Collect :</p style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        <p>You consent to us collecting information by using "log data" and "cookies," by obtaining information from your usage of our Services, and by asking for information when you buy a product, register for and/or use a Service, or do various other things, as described below.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Log Data</span> - You agree that when you visit the Gamathon Sites, whether as a non-registered visitor just browsing or as an individual who has registered via the Gamathon Sites (any of these, a "Gamathon User"), our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to a Gamathon Site, pages of the Gamathon Sites that you visit, information you search for on our Gamathon Sites and other statistics.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies</span>- Like many websites, we use "cookies" -- small data files transferred to your computer’s hard disk – to collect information. We use two kinds of cookies. First, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Gamathon Sites, to better understand how visitors interact with the Gamathon Sites, to monitor aggregate usage by Gamathon Users, and to monitor web traffic routing on the Gamathon Sites. Second, we utilise persistent cookies for persons who have registered with Gamathon to save their login information for future logins to the Gamathon Sites. While session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Gamathon Sites and then close your browser, persistent cookies remain. You can set your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Gamathon Sites or all functionality of the Services.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal Information</span> We ask for and/or receive Personal Information from you. At times, we ask you for personally identifiable information – information about you that can be used to identify you by itself or together with information which we have or are likely to have access to ("Personal Information") – which includes, but is not limited to, your name, photo, phone number, email address, website URL, instant message contact information, and postal address. We may also ask for and/or obtain other information such as your age, gender, [post or zip code], country and individual preferences. We ask for Personal Information in a number of situations, including when you register a product, purchase or register for a Service, sign up for a Promotion, opt-in to receive email notifications, in connection with your request for an offering or for personalisation of the Services you use or when you contact us via the Services, or other situations. In addition, we also obtain Personal Information by collecting and maintaining data on your use of Services, such as information on frequency, time and duration of use, and similar. You do not have to provide your Personal Information, but then certain features, offerings or Services may not be available to you, or you may not be able to complete a transaction. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and verify your identity to administer or respond to your inquiries or prevent fraud, or similar. We may also anonymise your Personal Information so that you are no longer identifiable from it and aggregate it with such information collected from other Gamathon Users and with log data and/or data from cookies to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Gamathon Sites, the Services, and/or our products, and to analyse and understand how the Gamathon Sites and/or Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance, to deliver a product or Service to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Advertising Networks and SNSs</p><br>

        <p>We work with third party advertising networks which may collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies when you use the Gamathon Sites. The information gathered by these advertising networks is used to make predictions about you, your interests or preferences and to display advertisements across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these ad networks to collect Personal Information about you on the Gamathon Sites. Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies and other technologies these ad networks may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these ad networks are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these ad networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, through which you may opt out of ad targeting from their member companies. To learn more, please visit Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p><br>

        <p>Each user may review, update, correct or have us delete the Personal Information he or she provided for or during use of the Services by contacting us at support@Gamathon.gg. If you have us completely delete all such information, then your account for your use of the Services may become deactivated, as applicable, and you may no longer be able to use or access the Service.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Phishing</p><br>

        <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Gamathon. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, ask for your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers through use of a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or through a telephone communication that we initiate without either a prior inquiry from you or a prior arrangement with you. For more information about phishing, visit https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-me/homeinternetusers/spot-signs-of-phishing.</p><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Security</p><br>

        <p>Gamathon is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks to your information. It is important to understand, however, that no website, server, Internet transmission, or method of electronic or other storage is 100% secure or "hacker proof." Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Gamathon Sites in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Links to Third-party Sites</p><br>

        <p>Our Gamathon Sites contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorisation or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Complaint</p><br>

        <p>If you have any concerns or a complaint about a breach of your privacy or the way we have handled your personal information, please email us at privacy@Gamathon.gg and inform us of the nature of your complaint.</p><br>

        <p>We will then investigate your complaint and endeavour to provide you with our response within a reasonable time (between 30-90 days dependent on your jurisdictional law) of receiving your request.  If, after receiving our response, you still consider that your privacy complaint remains unresolved, you may then, for example, refer your concern to the privacy regulator in the country where you reside.</p><br>
